# Procedural art with JavaScript

> Time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted time.

This repository contains some procedural art algorithms I like devising during my spare time. I don't use any external libraries and I rely on the HTML `<canvas>` element for rendering. Every time you open of the `html` files it will generate a random image. Each art work has a write up which you can access by clicking on the sections.
